# Vision

There are many talented developers in our community who can pool their thoughts and knowledge together to help create projects for Neo Tokyo Citizens and the world.

Whether it be something simple like an simple frontend for viewing our identities, or tracking the changes made, to a inventory viewer to lookup what addresses 
hold on IMX, to our own NFT alert/tracking system for tracking volume of NFT projects across multiple chains. Even a fully fledge game, we can use the knowledge in this
community to create most anything we desires, and help improve lives in even the smallest of ways.

# Proposals

I believe a good place to start would be community proposals. This could be used for anything, such as proposals for new Discord channels, community projects, 
charitable donations, etc. Eventually this should be setup through a DAO (decentralized automonous organization), which the developers in the community could even build. For now I like idea of this repository
to take an approach similar to EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) as seen here: [https://eips.ethereum.org/](https://eips.ethereum.org/)
